1. Static Position:
The static position is the default position value of an element. It follows the normal flow of the document. Elements with a static position are not affected by the top, bottom, left, or right properties.


<div class="static-position">
  This is a static positioned element.
</div>

<style>
.static-position {
  position: static;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: yellow;
}
</style>


2. Fixed Position:
The fixed position keeps the element fixed relative to the viewport, even when the page is scrolled. The fixed position is often used for creating elements such as navigation bars that stay fixed at a specific position on the screen.

```css
<div class="fixed-position">
  This is a fixed positioned element.
</div>

<style>
.fixed-position {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  right: 20px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: red;
}
</style>


3. Sticky Position:
The sticky position is a hybrid of relative and fixed positions. It behaves like a relative position within its container until a certain scroll threshold is reached, after which it becomes fixed. It remains fixed until the user scrolls back up to the threshold.

```css
<div class="sticky-position">
  This is a sticky positioned element.
</div>

<style>
.sticky-position {
  position: sticky;
  top: 20px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: green;
}
</style>
```

4. Relative Position:
The relative position allows you to position an element relative to its normal position. It can be moved using the top, bottom, left, or right properties. Other elements on the page will not be affected by the relative position of the element.

```css
<div class="relative-position">
  This is a relative positioned element.
</div>

<style>
.relative-position {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: blue;
}
</style>


5. Absolute Position:
The absolute position allows you to position an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the containing block. It is completely removed from the normal document flow and can overlap other elements. An absolute position is often used to create overlays or tooltips.


<div class="container">
  <div class="absolute-position">
    This is an absolute positioned element.
  </div>
</div>

<style>
.container {
  position: relative;
  height: 400px;
}

.absolute-position {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 50px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: purple;
}
</style>
